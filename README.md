# deepseek-api-console-tkinter
A DeepSeek local console written in Python. Minimal external dependencies. Just for fun :)

Install `OpenAI SDK` sdk before running the script.
```shell
pip install openai
```

If you are using Windows and do not know how to install `OpenAI SDK`, run `configure.bat` and follow the instructions it gives.

Install `FiraCodeVF.ttf` for better GUI visual effect. Click [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) to learn more about Fira Code, a kick-ass font developed by [Nikita Prokopov](https://github.com/tonsky). 

To change the default font, run script with two arguments:
```shell
python ds_api_console.pyw <font1> <font2>
```
Replace `<font1>` with a serif, non-mono font, and `<font2>` with a mono font to achieve the optimal visual effect.

Tweak the code if you want. Leave any comment. I'd like to hear your advice. :D
